    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p id = "bio">My name is James Thomas and I'm from Fayetteville, Georgia. My favorite food is sushi.
       I was in the U.S. Navy as a nuclear machinist's mate for a few years, worked at Barnes & Noble as a head cashier
       for a year and a half, and am now a student at CodeFellows. Unfortunately, I have no college degree, but that's okay
       because I'm <em>awesome</em>.</p>
